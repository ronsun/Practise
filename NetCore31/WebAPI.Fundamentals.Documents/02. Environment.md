## Environment

### Get from IWebHostEnvironment
`IWebHostEnvironment` provide some handy methods to check current environment, the prefix default as "ASPNETCORE_", so the envrionment variable is "ENVIRONMENT", samples following.  

``` csharp
_env.IsDevelopment();
_env.IsStaging();
_env.IsProduction();
_env.IsEnvironment("Development");
```

If you'd like to use your customize prefix, can set in `CreateHostBuilder()` method of `Programe.cs` as following.  
``` csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureHostConfiguration((config) =>
        {
            // Add here.
            config.AddEnvironmentVariables("RON_");
        })
    ;
```

By this case, the environment variable should be "RON_ENVIRONMENT".  

### Get from Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable()
Get environment variable by key, different with `provide`, no need to consider anything about prefix, the environment variables can be highly customize, it also can read environment variables from default key with prefix.  

Given environment variables "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT" is "Staging" and "MyEnv" is "MyQAT", following samples should reutrn "Stagin" and "MyQAT".  
``` csharp
Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT");
Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MyEnv");
```
